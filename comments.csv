1|Hey Bruce, I set up a stamps.com developer account earlier this week. I'll refer back to it once we get to the point where we are adding in the realtime shipping calculations.|ironman|2016-05-08 21:28||2016|5|08|21|28|0
1|If this is a hard-coding thing, then we're going to let it ride for a while. We might eventually ask for a re-sorting of the tiers, but it's not essential. |batman|2016-09-12 23:00||2016|9|12|23|0|0
1|Did we ever send you a recent Comcash Customer CSV to look at?|batman|2016-09-12 23:13||2016|9|12|23|13|0
1|@batman I think this might involve some more discussion/strategy. Integrating cashier who is keyed in will take a bit of work, so I am thinking about how best to approach this.|ironman|2017-04-07 21:17||2017|4|07|21|17|0
1|This is a relatively slow burner. By that, I mean that it is less important than general house account functionality and EOD, etc... Also, further workflow might actually impact future permissions. We've had a number of questions and concerns about permissions, so let's let it go until we have the rest of the cash register working.|batman|2017-05-07 16:40||2017|5|07|16|40|0
2|Hey, you can add shipping methods now. My advice would be to set up multiple shipping providers in the presets, one for each individual, and then various combinations you need to use separated by commas in the shipping provider name field (UPS,USPS). This should be adequate for now. And then in the future if we decide to make multiple selections possible, it should be easy to parse that field and separate it out.|ironman|2017-10-01 16:42||2017|10|01|16|42|0
2|First of all, this is crashing when I try to add new providers: MassAssignmentException in Model.php line 444: provider_name in Model.php line 444|batman|2017-10-01 19:56||2017|10|01|19|56|0
2|Second of all, I'm not sure how much further we want to push this until we know how it's going to work on the back end - that is, how the item's shipping tab, the e-cart, and the shipper's website will all be working together. It's nice for us to set up the rules for ourselves, but in the store, we're going to be handling it all manually, anyway. Should we just leave it alone or keep filling stuff out? Your thoughts?|batman|2017-10-01 19:58||2017|10|01|19|58|0
2|Yeah, it sounds like we have bigger fish to ship. I'll put this on the back burner.|ironman|2017-11-01 02:38||2017|11|01|2|38|0
3|@batman What if we added columns to the items listing page to adjust inventory there? We already have searching and filtering by brand, etc. Or it could be a button that opens a small dialog into which you enter the inventory change. Thoughts?|ironman|2018-05-03 02:33||2018|5|03|2|33|0

3|Bruce, I'm taking this ticket on from Tony and have a question about the 'Advanced Search' link that you'd like to have show up in the IRT form. When someone clicks on `Advanced Search`: - It should be searching items, yes? (Moving forward I'm going to base these other questions on the assumption that 'yes' is the answer here); - Once you see the advanced search page with the filterable items, what's the expected behavior? Have an option to add the item to the IRT form that called the Advanced Search page?|blackwidow|2018-12-03 20:01||2018|12|03|20|1|0
4|I'm going ahead and programming all the services logic. Hope it works out. Also confusing: 'Services' as a tier refers to the accounting system, and is a catch-all for anything that is not an actual item. This tier includes Production, Repair, and Other services. Just checked the thesaurus to see if we could break that word up a bit, but - in short - we can't. Maybe, for clarity, we should refer to the top box as 'non-used' instead of 'new'...Also, is Penny using the 5000 COGS account as a default? What triggers this default? It might be better if she defaulted to 'DEFAULT' or something that was really obvious when we are scanning the CSV downloads. The more obvious it is, the easier it will be for us to find them and fix them manually. There won't be many, but there will always be exceptions.|batman|||2017|1|13|20|41|26
4|This would also probably get rid of the States preset.|batman|||2016|9|13|22|9|0
4|I think the biggest issue is sometimes we have items that sell at a quantity of 1, but then we might have the same item on a second line item with a quantity of 10. This makes it a little more difficult to get an accurate quantity and total sum, but if this is super important I can take a look. As for handling lots of records, I think it might make sense to add a filter by date menu to this. What do you think?|ironman|||2016|12|13|17|23|49
4|We've talked it through and I think it's fine as is - at least for the time being. We're excited about this feature, but mostly for unique items. For the new products and the services, I don't know how (or if) we're going to be using this function. I'd like to table it until we're in the thick of development for sales reports, or until we've used Penny for a year and figured out an actual wish list. Right now, it's fine. And there are other things more on fire.|batman|||2016|12|13|18|28|38

6|Yeah, I think adding that option to the conditions dropdown is a good idea. It should automatically add it to the same check as the used fields.|ironman|||2017|1|16|6|16|58
7|I have already programmed all of the production SKUs in their new field, expecting that to be easier. I'm speaking about the QB coding in the Tier preset. If it works better, I can re-do it to the used filed. Currently, the used field is just '000' for everything. Couple other little questions down here in the comments, too.|batman|||2017|1|16|17|8|51
7|*Also, is Penny using the 5000 COGS account as a default? What triggers this default?* Currently the COGS fields all default to 000 if nothing has been explicitly entered for the associated tier in the presets manager. *Maybe, for clarity, we should refer to the top box as 'non-used' instead of 'new'...* It's totally up to youâ€”you can change that in the presets and see how it works. Just update the new field to have the new text. Most importantly, do not delete the new field, as I am keying off its ID in the database. BUT, now I see a potential issue. I was developing on my local machine, which does not have the updated conditions that production has. Aha. Let me know if things are generally working as desired or if you can update stuff on your end to work with it. If not, I can sync up the conditions and fix any little issues. *It might be better if she defaulted to 'DEFAULT' or something that was really obvious when we are scanning the CSV downloads. The more obvious it is, the easier it will be for us to find them and fix them manually. There won't be many, but there will always be exceptions.* Do you mean just for the CSV download, or globally? *I have already programmed all of the production SKUs in their new field, expecting that to be easier. I'm speaking about the QB coding in the Tier preset. If it works better, I can re-do it to the used filed. Currently, the used field is just '000' for everything.* Let me know what works best for you and I can make it happen.|ironman|||2017|1|16|18|28|6
7|For clarity, we're speaking about the 'new' and 'used' fields on the Tier preset manager, as here: New COGS Code (last Three Digits, Ex: 024 For Darkroom Materials) --If there's a way to change those field headings, I sure can't find it.|batman|||2017|1|16|18|52|8
8|If we could have Penny check the Used conditions (as I think she's currently doing) and then lump the non-used conditions into the 'new' field for the QB Tier editor, then everything should work fine.|batman|||2017|1|16|18|53|8
8|As far as the default QB accounts, I was speaking about the CSV download mostly - principally, when we're scanning the columns it will be easier for us to pick out. However, this is not worth any effort on your part. It's easy enough for us to scan for '000' in the same column.|batman|||2017|1|16|18|54|33
8|Ah, ok. You had the headings thing in another ticket, right? I got that fixed but have not pushed it up yet. Those headings are currently not editable by you.|ironman|||2017|1|16|19|23|38
10|If it makes a difference, we don't really need to be able to edit those fields. As long as we're clear on item Quick-booking correctly. 'used' takes up all the numeric conditions and 'non-used' (what' currently 'new' taking up all the other conditions.|batman|||2017|1|16|19|56|41
10|@batman Just spent about a half hour on this and it's still not working quite right, so i will defer to you. I can spend more time on it if you prefer, just let me know.|ironman|||2017|8|16|16|26|20
10|I'd say keep it under an hour. There are much bigger fish to fry, obviously. If you don't want to waste the work and feel that you're close, great. If you want to forget about it, that's just fine.|batman|||2017|8|16|17|29|44
9|Wondering about this - shipping 1 roll of film vs 10 rolls of the same film - and also a note from a couple of days ago re: uploading customer data. Have you had a chance to fool around with the Stamps developer thing yet?|batman|||2016|9|16|18|39|54
9|Thinking about the deletion of records. What's going to happen if a customer gets deleted who has sales history? Or an item that has sales history?|batman|||2016|12|17|0|42|41
