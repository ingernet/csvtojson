1|Size Option Missing|.09a|Closed|Medium|Minor|Functional|Always|Tony Stark|Bruce Wayne|Somewhere along the way we lost the 'size' column.  This is not the physical size that is in the shipping section, but the size relative to other products, i.e. 500ml Rapid fixer vs 1L Rapid fixer or 36 exposure 400Fuji vs 24 exposure 400Fuji. We think we need this.  |||||1|24/06/2016 18:41:52 |25/06/2016 12:02:15 
2|Multiple Reports of Filtering Issues|.09a|Closed|Critical|Critical|Functional|Always|Tony Stark|Bruce Wayne|- 'Accessory' does not seem to be tripping the accessory filters. - Nikon Speedlite SB24 is in Photographica and Photo Equipment and accessory but does not give us any filter to select from.  We checked the presets, and 'flash' is there, but not coming up. - What's going to drive the available filters for each item? When I try to add a camera, i.e. the Hasselblad 501CM, I'm not able to enter the Camera Type unless I check the 'Lens' filter under photo equipment. I want to make sure we have the drivers correctly identified so we can select the proper filters. - It looks like the 'Filters' aren't showing up correctly under several items I'm checking. What's a good way for us to get that information to you? |||||1|24/06/2016 18:43:29 |25/06/2016 13:13:29 
3|Make Metropolis default Location|.09a|Resolved|Medium|Minor|Functional|Always|Tony Stark|Natasha Romanova|Can we have 'location' default to 'Metropolis', and then we'll be able to add or change the much smaller subset that needs changing?  Just trying to reduce key strokes when we start entering a lot of items.  Also, hopefully, we can have 'location' have a default of 'St Johns' that we *can* manually change.  Also, we can move that off of the front page.|||||0|24/06/2016 18:44:01 |24/06/2016 19:49:56 
4|Default Preset Sorts to Alpha|.09a|Closed|Medium|Minor|Functional|Always|Tony Stark|Tony Stark|We need Alpha Sort for Manufacturer. I was adding an item and when I didn't see the manufacturer on the first look, I added the name. When I went back and to find the one I entered, i found it was already in the system. Can we set a warning to help catch duplications?<br />|||||2|24/06/2016 18:47:51 |25/06/2016 12:00:32 
5|Ability to choose Category/Sub/Sub-Sub First|.09a|Resolved|Critical|Critical|Usability|Always|Tony Stark|Natasha Romanova|* It took me a bit to get the flow down to enter each item. I'm gong to ponder ways we might be able to streamline the process. Mostly I was thrown by the need to enter Item Descriptions and such before entering the Categories, Sub-Categories, etc. If this is the most efficient way to make things work, I can write up my training notes to indicate that, but if you have any ideas on how to help that flow, I'm all ears. <br />And to that effect, I'm thinking of ways that starting with category and dept would actually inform what fields need to be filled out, and which ones would be automatically denied.  Is this even possible? For example, when you select 'services' as the master, then we will not need 'condition' 'condition description' or 'manufacturer'. <br />|||||1|24/06/2016 18:51:23 |28/06/2016 01:48:34 
6|SKU unique constraint and new position on forms|.09a|Resolved|High|Major|Usability|Always|Tony Stark|Natasha Romanova|What's the main identifying field?   Traditionally, we use SKU, and we force the SKUs to all be unique.  We can't use the Item Description as a unique ID, since there will be much repetition. This implies that we should probably start with the SKU field. To start with here's what we'd prefer in the left column:<br />SKU<br />Item Number<br />Item Name|||||2|24/06/2016 18:52:13 |29/06/2016 14:26:50 
7|Sub Category selection needs to auto select parent cats|.09a|Closed|Medium|Major|Usability|Always|Tony Stark|Bruce Wayne|Hierarchy:<br />For sure we need it to prefill parent categories - we just want to check 'film' and have it check 'Film and materials' and 'photographica',  and ideally then black out 'services' and 'machines' and other unrelated categories.|||||2|24/06/2016 18:56:09 |12/07/2016 14:58:43 
8|Question: Does entering a preset require a sort order|.09a|Closed|Medium|Minor|Suggestion|Always|Tony Stark|Bruce Wayne|When entering a new preset, do we need to establish a 'sort order'. It seems to commit without it.|||||1|24/06/2016 18:57:06 |25/06/2016 12:01:53
