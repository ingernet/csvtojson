# csvtojson

A quick little mapper thing I had to slap together when the company that hosted our ticket tracking system quietly turned out the lights and snuck out the back door in the middle of the night. We were able to export our issue tickets with most of the metadata intact, but of course the new system we went to required JSON, when all we had was a couple of CSVs.

Written in Python 3, no fancy libs required.

## Usage:

`./converter.py > exportfile.json`
